AUTOGPT+ SERP API

Open AI Setup:
1: login to your openAI api account and create an API KEY
2: Link for Api Keys:  https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3:Add your Api key in the code where mentioned.

Serp Api Setup:
1: login to your Serp Api api account and create an API KEY
2: Link:  https://serpapi.com/dashboard
3:Add your Api key in the code where mentioned.


STEPS TO RUN:
1. In the Command Terminal navigate to the project directory. {cd autogpt}
2. create a virtual environment "python -m venv myenv"
3. move to myenv "cd myenv"
4. activate myenv "Scripts\activate"
5. pip install openai requests serpapi
6. python auto.py



Results:  
Serpapi runs as it should and returns the titles and links of query which is Current events in this case. The user can change the query by changing the "query:Current events" and the api search endpoint link in the code.

OpenAi Assistant succesfully sends the query request to openai and the assistant is created on the openai platform. the query fails after sending two more requests after which the request per minute limit is excited (rpm=3).

Errors I Encountered:

 "last_error": {
        "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
        "message": "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details."
    },
This might be fixed by a premium openai account. else if given some more time i will fix it.
